1: Simmer and dice the beef thoroughly. Season with pepper and salt as the beef cooks to a consistent brown grey. Well seasoned meat tastes good.
2: Do the same with the breakfast sausage in a separate pan. The sausage should finish cooking before the beef.
3: After browning, mix all the meats and spices together thoroughly in a large crock pot.
4: Add the liquids and stir very thoroughly. The viscosity of the chili should walk the line between stew and soup.
5: Add the kidney beans and stir gently. The kidney beans are delicate.
6: Add the whole peppers. You may wish to remove loose seeds.
7: Cook and sample for a couple hours or so on a very low simmer. The temperature should be a little bit less than what the meats were simmered at. Start with a low temperature and slowly increase as necessary. Mix gently every 15 - 20 minutes. Be certain to stir the bottommost contents to the surface to avoid burning. A couple bubbles will float to the surface after about 45 - 60 minutes. A few more when will appear the chili is finished cooking.
8: Leave set for an hour or so.
9: You may wish to remove the whole peppers.
10: Serve with a bread, chips, pretzels, crackers, and a smile.
