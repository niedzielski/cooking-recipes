## Directions

0. Simmer and dice the beef thoroughly. Season with pepper and salt as the beef
   cooks to a consistent brown grey. Do the same with the breakfast sausage in a
   separate pan. The sausage should finish cooking before the beef.
0. After browning, mix all the meats and spices together thoroughly in a large
   crock pot.
0. Add the liquids and stir very thoroughly. The viscosity of the chili should
   be between stew and soup.
0. Add the kidney beans and stir gently but thoroughly.
0. Add the whole peppers. You may wish to remove loose seeds.
0. Cook and sample for a couple hours or so on a very low simmer. The
   temperature should be a little bit less than what the meats were simmered at.
   Start with a low temperature and slowly increase as necessary. Mix gently
   every 15 - 20 minutes. Be certain to stir the bottommost contents to the
   surface to avoid burning. A couple bubbles will float to the surface after
   about 45 - 60 minutes. A few more when will appear the chili is finished
   cooking.
0. Leave set for an hour or so.
0. You may wish to remove the whole peppers.
0. Serve with a bread, chips, pretzels, crackers, and a smile.
